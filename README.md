## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
App: Spotify
* Personalized daily mix
* Yearly Wrapped
* Music blend with friends

App: Venmo

* Simple UI
* Request money from friends

App: LinkedIn

App I'd like to build:
* A class planner that integrates with UCLA’s degree audit system. The a class planner that would suggest courses based on a student’s unfinished requirement in their major and minor, alert them to potential issues like prerequisites or class availability, and offer alternative courses based on what the student may have on their ‘wishlist’. By offering real-time updates and personalized recommendations, the tool would streamline the planning process and help students stay on track with their academic goals.
